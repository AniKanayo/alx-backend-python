# 0x00. Python - Variable Annotations

This project covers the concept of variable annotations in Python and focuses on advanced Python topics. It explores type annotations, how to use them to specify function signatures and variable types, duck typing, and how to validate code with mypy.

## Resources

- [Python 3 typing documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
- [MyPy cheat sheet](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following topics to anyone, without the help of Google:

- Type annotations in Python 3
- Usage of type annotations for function signatures and variable types
- Understanding of duck typing
- Validation of code using mypy

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of asic annotations - concat

Write a type-annotated function `concat` that takes two strings `str1` and `str2` as arguments and returns a concatenated string.

- Filename: `1-concat.py`

### 2. Basic annotations - floor

Write a type-annotated function `floor` that takes a float `n` as an argument and returns the floor of the float.

- Filename: `2-floor.py`

### 3. Basic annotations - to string

Write a type-annotated function `to_str` that takes a float `n` as an argument and returns the string representation of the float.

- Filename: `3-to_str.py`

### 4. Define variables

Define and annotate the following variables with the specified values:

- `a`: an integer with a value of `1`
- `pi`: a float with a value of `3.14`
- `i_understand_annotations`: a boolean with a value of `True`
- `school`: a string with a value of `"Holberton"`

- Filename: `4-define_variables.py`

### 5. Complex types - list of floats

Write a type-annotated function `sum_list` that takes a list `input_list` of floats as an argument and returns their sum as a float.

- Filename: `5-sum_list.py`

### 6. Complex types - mixed list

Write a type-annotated function `sum_mixed_list` that takes a list `mxd_lst` of integers and floats and returns their sum as a float.

- Filename: `6-sum_mixed_list.py`

### 7. Complex types - string and int/float to tuple

Write a type-annotated function `to_kv` that takes a string `k` and an int or float `v` as arguments and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the string `k`. The second element is the square of the int/float `v` and should be annotated as a float.

- Filename: `7-to_kv.py`

Feel free to modify and enhance the README file based on your requirements and preferences.all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- All modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- All functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
- Documentation should be descriptive sentences explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (length will be verified)
- Code must use pycodestyle (version 2.5) style
- All files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Tasks

### 0. Basic annotations - add

Write a type-annotated function `add` that takes two floats `a` and `b` as arguments and returns their sum as a float.

- Filename: `0-add.py`

### 1. B
