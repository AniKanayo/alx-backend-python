Creating a clear and informative README file is crucial for any project,
including those with unit tests and integration tests. This README provides
an overview of the testing strategy, instructions for running the tests,
and other relevant information.

## Getting Started

Explain how to set up the project and its dependencies on a local machine.
Provide clear steps for cloning the repository and installing any necessary requirements.

### Prerequisites

List the prerequisites that need to be installed on the local machine before
running the tests. Include the versions if applicable.

### Installation

Step-by-step instructions on how to install the project and its dependencies.
Include any configuration needed for the testing environment.

## Running the Tests

Explain how to run the tests for the project. Include instructions on
running both unit tests and integration tests.

### Unit Tests

Explain the purpose of unit tests and their scope. Describe how the unit
tests are organized and where to find them in the project structure.

```bash
# Provide a command to run the unit tests
$ python -m unittest discover -s tests/unit -p "test_*.py"
```

### Integration Tests

Explain the purpose of integration tests and their scope. Describe how the integration
tests are organized and where to find them in the project structure.

```bash
# Provide a command to run the integration tests
$ python -m unittest discover -s tests/integration -p "test_*.py"
```

## Test Coverage

Include information about test coverage, such as the percentage of code coverage by
unit tests and integration tests. You can use coverage tools to generate
reports and include the commands to generate these reports.

```bash
# Command to generate test coverage report (if using coverage.py)
$ coverage run -m unittest discover -s tests/unit -p "test_*.py"
$ coverage run -m unittest discover -s tests/integration -p "test_*.py"
$ coverage report -m
```
